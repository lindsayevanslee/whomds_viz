This shiny app is for visualizing data from the WHO Model Disability Survey.

This app is still very much an experiment. It is not possible yet for users to try out the app because the files here do not include the necessary data. 

Please find more about the WHO Model Disability Survey here:

Please find the WHO Health Equity Assessment tool for a shiny app for health data visualization:
